BprintHelp = Prints the value of its inner component as a String to the console.
BvalueHelp = Input field for literals. \n(if a Variable of type number is set to a literal, \nthe program will attempt to parse the literal)
BsetHelp = Sets the value of the left hand side variable \nequal to the value of the variable or value on the right hand side.\n If the right hand side is a Variable \n and its type doesn't match that of the left hand side \na red border will indicate an error.
BmakeHelp = Creates a new Variable with given unique name and type. \nScope of the variable is the Toplevel to which it belongs \n(Handler or Function). \nThe button on the right end of the block will create a reference to this Variable.
BifHelp = If the condition in the condition box evaluates to true the body of the if block will be executed.\n If the condition doesn't return a boolean or a value a red border will indicate an error. 
BwhileHelp =  As long as the condition in the condition box evaluates to true the body of the if block will be executed.\n If the condition doesn't return a boolean or a value a red border will indicate an error. 
BemitHelp = The dropdown menu will show all possible events to emit in the program. \nIf a selected event has members, \nfields will be shown to set the value of the member equal to that of a variable set in the box. \nIf no event of this type was emitted by this class, \nall its intances will now have an output event of the type of the selected event. \nRemoving this emit block will have the complementary result. 
BhandlerHelp = A handler handles the input event to which its connect via the rectangle button on the top left of this block.\n If connected an access block can access the members of the event. 
BappearHelp = Sets the appearance of the instance to String given by the execution of its inner component if it exist. 
BlockHelp = Locks the given Variable. If this is not a member, nothing will be locked. 
BunlockHelp = UnLocks the given Variable. If this is not a member, nothing will be locked.
BsleepHelp = Pauses in this place for given amount of seconds.
BrandomHelp = Generates a number variable with value between 0.0-1.0.
BhideHelp = Hides the instance in the canvas.
BshowHelp = Shows the instance in the canvas.
BconcatHelp = Concatenate the variables/values as Strings and returns a new String variable.
BlengthHelp = Returns the length of a given String.
BcharatHelp = Returns the character at the given right hand side Number Variable index in the given left hand side String variable.
BelseHelp = ... 
BreturnHelp = If the return is in a function it will return from that function \nand check if the type of return equals the set return type of the function. \nIf placed in handler it returns from that handler.
BfunctionHelp = Function definition. \nHovering over the parameters will show their type. \nClicking on a parameter will create a reference to that parameter.
BaccessHelp = Access block is only usable in a handler connected to a input event. \nIf placed in such handler all members of the event will be available for selection. \nThe value of the selected member of the event will be returned. 
BifelseHelp = If the condition in the condition box evaluates to true the body of the if block will be executed \notherwise the body of the else will be executed. \nIf the condition doesn't return a boolean or a value a red border will indicate an error. 
BforeverHelp = The body of this block will be repeat forever.
BmoveHelp = Moves the instance in the canvas x- and y-pixels relative to its current position.
BbinopHelp = Executes the currently set operation on the given variable(s), \n and returns a variable of the correct type. \nIf operation is not possible on given variable(s) a red border will indicate an error. \nFor detailed description of operations and return types check manual.
bfunccallHelp = A function call, this calls the function belonging to the call-block. \nParameters that aren't filled in, are set to default values. \nThe return value doesn't need to be captured. \nIf you try to catch an return value but no return was done, the program will generate a runtime error
